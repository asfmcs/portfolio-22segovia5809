         <p> <strong>Bali is most popular island holiday destination in the Indonesian archipelago.</strong> The island’s home to an ancient culture that's known for its warm hospitality. Exotic temples and palaces set against stunning natural backdrops are some of its top attractions. Dining in Bali presents endless choices of local or far-flung cuisine. After sunset, famous nightspots come to life offering exciting clubbing and packed dance floors. Inland, towering volcanoes and pristine jungles greet you with plenty to see and do. Most can't stay away from the beach for long, though.

<h2>Heres 3 interesting facts about Bali:</h2 align="center">
<br>
<ol>
  <li>The world’s most expensive coffee in the world comes from Bali. It is called Kopi Luwak and is not your typical coffee bean… <em>collect the beans from the digestion of a Civat Cat</em>, which is a shy cat-like creature living in Asia. The Civat cat only eats the ripest and finest coffee cherries but doesn’t digest the bean</li>
  <br>
  <li>When thinking about the beaches in Bali you’d probably think of white beaches and clear blue sea. While there are some stunning beaches like that around the island, <em>there are some with black sand instead!</em> Take for example Lovina Beach, where the beach is covered in black sand that comes from the cooled lava of the Mt Agung volcano.</li>
  <br>
  <li>There are a lot of different languages and dialects spoken all over Indonesia, although Bahasa Indonesia is the country’s official language. Most Balinese residents speak 3 languages: Balinese, Indonesian and English (the last one mostly due to tourism).</li>
